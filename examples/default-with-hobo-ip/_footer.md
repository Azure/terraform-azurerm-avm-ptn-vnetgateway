## Important Notes

- **ExpressRoute Only**: This feature is **exclusively available for ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateways**, not VPN gateways
- This feature must be configured during initial ExpressRoute gateway deployment
- The public IP address is managed by Azure and not visible as a separate resource in your subscription
- **AzAPI Provider**: This example uses the AzAPI provider for direct access to Azure ARM REST APIs and advanced properties

## HOBO Regional Rollout - Important Mitigation

### 500 Internal Server Error Issue

If you encounter a **500 Internal Server Error** when running `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` on existing ExpressRoute gateways, this is likely due to the HOBO feature being rolled out to your region after your gateway was initially deployed.

**Root Cause**: Terraform attempts to add a public IP configuration to an existing ExpressRoute gateway in a HOBO-enabled region, which Azure rejects with an internal server error.

### Mitigation Steps for Existing Gateways

If you have an existing ExpressRoute gateway deployed before HOBO rollout in your region:

1. **Update your configuration** to enable HOBO:
   ```hcl
   module "vgw" {
     source = "../.."

     type = "ExpressRoute"
     hosted_on_behalf_of_public_ip_enabled = true  # Add this line
     # Remove any explicit public IP configurations
   }
   ```

2. **Plan and apply** the changes - the module will automatically handle the public IP removal and destruction when HOBO is enabled.

For more information about Azure Virtual Network Gateway configuration options, see the [main module documentation](../../README.md).

# Usage

Ensure you have Terraform installed and the Azure CLI authenticated to your Azure subscription.

Navigate to the directory containing this configuration and run:

```pwsh
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
